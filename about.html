            <p>I'm a Mechanical Engineer student at the <a href="http://www.unr.edu.ar/" target="_blank">University of Rosario</a>.
                I'm 8 courses away from my title (hopefully I get it in the next 2 years). I'm currently working at <a href="http://indiv.com/ar/mercado-ar/home"
                    target="_blank">INDIV SA</a>, in Argentina, as a "junior" engineer (since 2010). My primary job is to design
                and control the production of the <a href="http://indiv.com/ar/mercado-ar/productos/galpones-prefabricados/galpones-prefabricados/sistema-galvanizado/detalle"
                    target="_blank">metallic structures</a> the company sells.</p>

            <p>I'm 27 years old, and I always lived in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. I played football all my life, in a lot
                of amateur teams (mostly friend-based teams).</p>

            <p>I also love to play computer games, in particular, a strategy team-based game called <a href="http://blog.dota2.com/"
                    target="_blank">DOTA 2</a>. I played this game for a long time, even in good tournaments, at a semi-professional
                level. I played most of my time on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PPDota2/" target="_blank">Equipo Sólido</a>,
                a team I founded with my brother and friends. Playing DOTA on a high competitive level taught me a lot about
                Team Communication and Coordination, skills I later applied to my job with great personal results.</p>

            <p>I'm currently living with my amazing girlfriend Virginia, and beside my career and job, I started to learn Web
                and Software development, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning. I find these topics super interesting,
                and I´m learning them all online, on different platforms (<a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a>,
                <a href="">Udacity</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com"
                    target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, etc.). I found that online learning is super beneficial for me, and I would
                love to do some online teaching in a near future.</p>

            <p>I'm still a student on this topics, but hopefully, I get to apply these concepts in real life applications soon.
                For the time being, I will use my site to help me with my studies, and, luckily, help others.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading this, best regards!</p>
